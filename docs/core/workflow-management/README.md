# WORKFLOW Management

**Core Responsibility 4: Work Process Definition and Validation**

WORKFLOW defines how work processes are executed and validated, with clear integration points for information structure (ISSUE) and runtime systems.

## Purpose

- **Define work processes** - How specific types of work should be done
- **Validate process execution** - Test creation and completion
- **Provide execution guidance** - Clear instructions for doing the work
- **Handle runtime integration** - Connect to external systems as needed

## Core Concept

**Task = Issue on execution queue**  
**Issue = Task at rest**  
**Workflow = The process contract that defines how work is done**

## WORKFLOW Structure

Each workflow is a **self-contained folder** with three core parts:

```
workflows/
└── WORKFLOW_NAME/
    ├── creation/
    │   ├── test.js           # "Is this properly formed for this process?"
    │   └── template.md       # Shows ISSUE what structure is needed
    ├── execution/
    │   ├── guide.md          # "How to do this work"
    │   └── scripts/          # Runtime integration, automation
    └── sign-off/
        ├── test.js           # "Is this process properly completed?"
        └── criteria.md       # Process completion definition
```

## Three Core Parts

### 1. Creation
- **Creation Test**: Validates that ISSUE provided the right information structure for this workflow
- **Template**: Shows ISSUE management what structure is needed
- **Purpose**: Ensure process can start with proper foundation

### 2. Execution  
- **Execution Guide**: Step-by-step process instructions
- **Runtime Scripts**: Integration with external systems, APIs, tools
- **Purpose**: Provide clear process execution path

### 3. Sign-off
- **Completion Test**: Validates that the process was properly completed
- **Criteria**: Clear specification of what constitutes process completion
- **Purpose**: Ensure process finished correctly

## Integration Points

### "Compile Time" Integration with ISSUE
- **ISSUE** manages information structure ("what data goes in the task at rest")
- **WORKFLOW** validates ISSUE's information structure via creation tests
- **Templates** show ISSUE what structure this workflow requires
- **Clean boundary**: ISSUE = data, WORKFLOW = process

### "Runtime" Integration (During Execution)
- **Depends on workflow nature** - some workflows are pure process, others need external systems
- **Runtime scripts** handle API calls, tool integration, system interaction
- **Execution environment** provides access to external dependencies

## Clean Separation of Concerns

| Responsibility | Handles |
|----------------|---------|
| **ISSUE Management** | Information structure, milestone organization, storage |
| **WORKFLOW Management** | Process definition, validation tests, runtime integration |
| **TASK Management** | Workflow assignment, execution coordination |

## TDC Implementation

Each workflow implements **Test-Driven Creation**:

```
Creation Test → Process Execution → Sign-off Test
```

- **Creation Test**: "Does ISSUE provide the right structure for this process?"
- **Process Execution**: "How do I execute this work process?"  
- **Sign-off Test**: "Was this process properly completed?"

## Workflow Lifecycle

### When Task Executes:
```
Task starts → WORKFLOW creation test (validates ISSUE structure) → 
Process execution (with runtime integration) → 
Sign-off test (validates process completion) → Done
```

### Dynamic Workflow Resolution:
- **Workflow exists**: Use it immediately
- **Workflow missing**: WORKFLOW can request/create it
- **Self-validating**: Workflows test their own requirements

## What WORKFLOW Does NOT Handle

- ❌ **Information structure** (ISSUE's responsibility)
- ❌ **Data storage/retrieval** (ISSUE's responsibility)  
- ❌ **Dependencies** between workflows (orchestration concern)
- ❌ **Workflow registry** (separate registry system)
- ❌ **Cross-workflow coordination** (orchestration)

## Benefits

- ✅ **Clean boundaries** - Process vs data structure separation
- ✅ **Compile-time validation** - Structure requirements clear upfront
- ✅ **Runtime flexibility** - External system integration as needed
- ✅ **Self-contained** - Each workflow owns its complete process
- ✅ **Quality gates** - Creation and sign-off tests ensure correctness

## Integration Examples

### Compile Time (WORKFLOW ↔ ISSUE)
```
WORKFLOW template says: "Need fields: title, description, priority"
ISSUE structure provides: title, description, priority, milestone
WORKFLOW creation test: ✅ Required fields present
```

### Runtime (WORKFLOW ↔ External Systems)
```
WORKFLOW execution may call:
- GitHub API (for issue creation)
- Build systems (for deployment)  
- Testing frameworks (for validation)
- Notification systems (for alerts)
```

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Folder-based workflow structure
- [ ] Creation test framework (ISSUE structure validation)
- [ ] Execution guide system
- [ ] Runtime integration framework
- [ ] Sign-off test framework
- [ ] Template system (ISSUE structure requirements)
- [ ] Dynamic workflow resolution
