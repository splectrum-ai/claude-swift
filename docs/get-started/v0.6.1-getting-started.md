# Get Started with SPlectrum Development - v0.6.1

**Generated**: 2025-07-27T11:36:24.703Z
**Scope**: VERSION_TRANSITION Step 6 - Onboarding Documentation from Actual Development Experience

## Quick Start Overview

This guide provides practical onboarding for SPlectrum development based on actual development experience during version v0.6.1. It focuses on what you actually need to know to contribute effectively.

## Prerequisites

Based on actual development requirements:

### Essential Requirements
- **Node.js v14+**: JavaScript runtime required for all SPlectrum operations
  - *Evidence*: Core runtime for all development activities
- **Git**: Version control system used for all development workflows
  - *Evidence*: Version control and workflow management

### Important Requirements
- **GitHub CLI (gh)**: Command-line tool for GitHub integration and project management
  - *Evidence*: Project automation and issue management

## Quickstart Guide

Follow these steps for fastest path to productive contribution:

### Step 1: Environment Setup
**Action**: Install prerequisites and clone repository
**Details**: Ensure Node.js v14+, Git, and GitHub CLI are installed
**Success Criteria**: Can run `node --version`, `git --version`, `gh --version`

### Step 2: Repository Initialization
**Action**: Navigate to spl1 directory and verify structure
**Details**: Familiarize yourself with docs/, claude/, and modules/ organization
**Success Criteria**: Can locate CLAUDE.md and understand folder structure

### Step 3: First Session
**Action**: Execute SESSION_START workflow
**Details**: Use `start sesame` command to initialize development session
**Success Criteria**: Audit logging starts and branch is verified

### Step 4: Explore Workflows
**Action**: Review available workflows in CLAUDE.md
**Details**: Understand sesame commands and workflow trigger system
**Success Criteria**: Can execute basic workflows like `next sesame`

### Step 5: First Contribution
**Action**: Start with documentation or simple development task
**Details**: Use GitHub project automation to select appropriate first issue
**Success Criteria**: Successfully complete a small development task

## Essential Workflows

These workflows are most frequently used and critical for effective development:

### Critical Workflows (Must Know)
- **SESSION_START**: Initialize development sessions with proper audit logging
  - *Usage*: Required at beginning of each development session

## Development Tools

Tools you'll actually use during development:

### Node.js
**Purpose**: Core runtime and script execution
**Usage**: Required for all development tools and automation
**Installation**: System package manager or NodeSource

### Git
**Purpose**: Version control and branch management
**Usage**: All development workflows and version tracking
**Installation**: System package manager

### GitHub CLI (gh)
**Purpose**: Issue management and project automation
**Usage**: Creating issues, managing PRs, project board automation
**Installation**: GitHub CLI installer or package manager

### ripgrep (rg)
**Purpose**: Fast code searching and analysis
**Usage**: Preferred over grep for codebase analysis
**Installation**: System package manager or cargo install

### Claude Code tools
**Purpose**: Version transition automation and analysis
**Usage**: Strategic analysis, repository maintenance, knowledge management
**Installation**: Included in claude/tools/ directory

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

Learn from actual development challenges encountered:

### Incorrect audit log paths
**Problem**: Using old `audit/` path instead of `claude/project/audit/`
**Solution**: Always use `claude/project/audit/current/current.log` for current logging
**Prevention**: Check CLAUDE.md for current audit architecture

### Version reference confusion
**Problem**: Updating architectural examples when fixing version references
**Solution**: Only update current platform docs in docs/guides/ and docs/specifications/
**Prevention**: Understand thematic folder organization before version updates

### Session file management
**Problem**: Thinking session files in current/ need archival
**Solution**: Session files in current/ are normal operational state
**Prevention**: Understand that archival happens during close_version workflow

### Workflow execution order
**Problem**: Not following systematic step-by-step workflow completion
**Solution**: Complete each workflow step fully before proceeding to next
**Prevention**: Use todo list tracking and single-step completion pattern

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Environment Setup**: Install all essential prerequisites
2. **Execute First Session**: Run `start sesame` and explore basic workflows
3. **Review Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with docs/guides/ and CLAUDE.md
4. **Select First Issue**: Use `next sesame` to find appropriate starting work

### Learning Path
1. **Week 1**: Master SESSION_START, basic workflows, and documentation structure
2. **Week 2**: Practice development workflows and GitHub integration
3. **Week 3**: Understand version management and more advanced workflows
4. **Ongoing**: Contribute to knowledge base improvement and workflow enhancement
