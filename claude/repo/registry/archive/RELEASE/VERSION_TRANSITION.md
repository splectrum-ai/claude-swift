# VERSION_TRANSITION Sub-Workflow

**Note:** This is a specialized workflow coordinated by the main VERSION workflow.

## Version Transition Process

Systematic transition workflow to process development knowledge and prepare for next version after release completion.

## Trigger
**User-Friendly**: `transition sesame`
**Technical**: `VERSION_TRANSITION`

**Output**: Updated knowledge base, onboarding documentation, and clean next version preparation

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Execute Version Transition Script
```bash

# Execute comprehensive version transition processing
claude/wow/scripts/transition-manage version-transition

```

## Script Integration

The version transition process executes a comprehensive 7-step automation sequence:

### Automated Processing Steps
2. **Knowledge Base Sync**: Update documentation with development insights  
3. **Repository Maintenance**: Clean outdated content and validate links
4. **Strategic Analysis**: Generate operational reports and component interaction analysis
5. **Knowledge Base Updates**: Create user-facing reports and best practices documentation
6. **Onboarding Documentation**: Update get-started guides based on development experience
7. **Readiness Assessment**: Validate next version preparation and generate readiness report

### Automation Scripts Utilized
- `claude/wow/scripts/transition-manage knowledge-sync` - Knowledge base synchronization
- `claude/wow/scripts/transition-manage maintenance-analysis` - Repository cleanup
- `claude/wow/scripts/transition-manage strategic-analysis` - Strategic insights and reporting
- `claude/wow/scripts/transition-manage knowledge-update` - Knowledge base documentation
- `claude/wow/scripts/transition-manage get-started` - Onboarding documentation
- `claude/wow/scripts/transition-manage readiness-validation` - Readiness assessment

## Documentation Update Strategy

### Current Platform Documentation (Steps 2-3)
**Target Folders**: `docs/guides/`, `docs/specifications/` (current platform state)
1. **Development Guides**: Enhance with practical insights from version development
2. **System Specifications**: Update with actual implementation patterns and current architecture
3. **Process Documentation**: Refresh with proven workflow effectiveness and process improvements
4. **File References**: Ensure all current platform documentation references are accurate

### Knowledge Base Documentation (Step 5)
**Output**: `docs/knowledge-base/` (comprehensive technical reference)
1. **Component Interaction Guides**: Data-driven guides based on actual co-modification patterns
2. **Workflow Effectiveness**: Document proven patterns and process improvements from strategic analysis
3. **Architecture Evolution**: Capture architectural insights and design patterns discovered
4. **Development Best Practices**: Formalize successful development approaches and techniques

### Get Started Documentation (Step 6)  
**Output**: `docs/get-started/` (onboarding-focused)
1. **Prerequisites Analysis**: Real requirements based on actual development experience
2. **Quickstart Guides**: Streamlined onboarding for new team members
3. **Essential Workflows**: Core processes needed for effective contribution
4. **Common Pitfalls**: Challenges and solutions from version development

### Preserved Documentation (No Updates)
**Excluded Folders**: `docs/architecture/`, `docs/integration/`, `docs/management/`, `docs/workflows/`, `docs/reference/`
- Contains design patterns, integration examples, governance documents, methodology illustrations
- Historical version markers and example versions remain unchanged
- Architectural timelessness preserved

### Stale Content Identification
1. **Outdated References**: Remove references to changed file locations or obsolete approaches
2. **Superseded Documentation**: Identify documentation replaced by better or more current versions
3. **Experimental Content**: Archive proof-of-concept documentation that's no longer relevant
4. **Broken Links**: Fix or remove documentation links that no longer point to valid content

## Version Metrics Generation

### Development Activity Metrics
- **Session Analysis**: 12 sessions, 50 unique workflows, 416 total instances (v1.1.0 example)
- **Time Distribution**: Total development time and average session duration
- **Workflow Frequency**: Most common workflows and execution patterns
- **Work Type Categorization**: Development, operational, documentation, discussion, planning, testing
- **Planned vs Unplanned**: Ratio analysis of planned vs unplanned work
- **Component Activity**: Frequency of modification by file/component
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Average time per workflow type and completion rates

### Strategic Insights Extraction
- **Architecture Evolution**: How architectural understanding changed during version
- **Process Effectiveness**: Which workflows and processes proved most/least effective
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Areas where additional documentation or training would help
- **Success Patterns**: Development approaches that consistently produced good results

### Quality Indicators
- **Documentation Completeness**: Coverage of all components and processes developed
- **Knowledge Transfer Readiness**: How well the version development would onboard new team members
- **Process Maturity**: Evolution of development practices and systematic approaches
- **Technical Debt Assessment**: Areas needing attention or refactoring in future versions

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Post-RELEASE_PROCESS Integration
- VERSION_TRANSITION automatically triggered after successful RELEASE_PROCESS completion
- Processes closed version audit data moved by RELEASE_PROCESS
- Ensures knowledge management happens at natural version boundaries

### Pre-Development Integration
- Prepares clean knowledge base for next version development
- Establishes baseline understanding for new version work
- Ensures development starts with most current knowledge and prerequisites

### Continuous Knowledge Evolution
- Systematic knowledge capture and processing prevents knowledge debt
- Regular documentation updates keep knowledge base current and useful
- Historical analysis enables continuous improvement of development processes

## Success Criteria

- All current platform documentation reflects actual development patterns from version
- Current system specifications updated with real implementation patterns
- Development guides enhanced with practical insights
- File references accurate and links validated for current platform docs
- No stale or outdated information in current platform documentation
- Experimental or obsolete content properly archived
- Version reference consistency maintained in current platform folders only
- Architectural examples and methodology illustrations preserved unchanged
- Version metrics provide clear picture of development activity
- [ ] Component interaction patterns analyzed and documented
- [ ] Process improvements identified and documented
- [ ] Success patterns captured for replication in future versions

### Knowledge Base Updates (Step 5)
- [ ] Component interaction guides created based on actual co-modification data
- [ ] Workflow effectiveness patterns documented from strategic analysis
- [ ] Architecture insights captured and formalized
- [ ] Development best practices extracted and documented

### Get Started Documentation (Step 6)
- [ ] Prerequisites updated based on actual development experience
- [ ] Quickstart guides created for new team member onboarding
- [ ] Essential workflows documented for effective contribution
- [ ] Common pitfalls and solutions captured from version development

**Note**: Previous Step 7 (Next Version Readiness) removed as redundant - all objectives accomplished by Steps 4-6:
- Knowledge base updates completed in Step 5
- Onboarding documentation completed in Step 6  
- Version planning foundation established in Step 4
- Audit structure maintained by RELEASE_PROCESS, not VERSION_TRANSITION
