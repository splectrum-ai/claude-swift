# PATCH_RELEASE Sub-Workflow

**Note:** This is a specialized workflow coordinated by the main RELEASE workflow.

## Trigger
Called from main RELEASE workflow when user requests patch release.

## Overview


## Workflow Steps

### 1. Pre-Release Validation
- Verify all issues closed
- Confirm all current version work completed
- Validate repository clean state

### 2. Release Validation
- Verify repository is in clean state
- Confirm all patch-related changes are committed
- Validate version number format and increment

### 3. Commit Preparation
```bash
# Commit any final changes for patch release
claude/wow/scripts/git-manage commit --message "Prepare for patch release v{VERSION}"
```

### 4. Project-Specific Release Process
```bash
# Check for project-specific patch release workflow
if [ -f "claude/project/workflows/patch-release.sh" ]; then
    echo "Executing project-specific patch release process..."
    claude/project/workflows/patch-release.sh
else
    echo "No project-specific patch release workflow found"
    echo "Standard patch release (no artifacts) - proceed to GitHub release"
fi
```

### 5. GitHub Release Creation
```bash
# Create and push version tag
claude/wow/scripts/git-manage release v{VERSION}

# Create GitHub release
claude/wow/scripts/github-manage release create v{VERSION} --title "{PROJECT_NAME} v{VERSION}" --notes-file release_notes.md
```

## Release Workflow Execution

### Workflow Execution Script
```bash

# Execute patch release script (contains all above steps with logging)
claude/wow/scripts/transition-manage patch-release

```

## Version Strategy
**Loaded from Project Hooks:**
- Version strategy and numbering patterns defined in `claude/project/version-config.md`
- Project-specific release criteria and artifact configuration
- Development phases and milestone structure

## Integration Points

### Version Management
- Follows Critical Version Management Rule from CLAUDE.md
- Maintains complete historical tracking through archived logs
- Clean separation between version development cycles

### Development Continuity  
- Archived logs preserve complete development history
- Fresh logs enable clean start for next version
- Historical audit trail remains accessible for future reference

### Release Artifacts
- Git tags for version identification
- GitHub releases with comprehensive release notes
- Self-extracting archive for distribution

## Benefits

### Historical Preservation
- Complete development history maintained in archived logs
- Learning documentation preserved for future reference  
- Decision context available for retrospective analysis

### Clean Version Transitions
- Fresh start for next version development
- Clear separation between version cycles
- Systematic release preparation process

### Release Accountability
- Comprehensive release notes documenting achievements
- Complete traceability from planning through implementation
- Systematic version closure process

## Release Best Practices

### Release Type Classification

#### **Planning vs Implementation Releases**
- **Planning Releases**: Focus on architectural documentation, no binary artifacts
- **Implementation Releases**: Include tested binary artifacts and deployment packages
- **Release Type** should be determined during release planning phase

#### **Release Notes Template**
```markdown
# Release Notes Template

[High-level description of release purpose and achievements]

## üìä Milestone Completion Summary
[Table format showing epic progress and issue completion]

## üèóÔ∏è Major Architectural Achievements
[Detailed breakdown by epic with key accomplishments]

## üìà Implementation Readiness
[What's prepared for next version implementation]

## üîß Development Infrastructure Improvements
[Workflow and tooling enhancements]

## üìö Key Documentation Created
[New documentation and knowledge assets]

## üöÄ Strategic Impact
[Long-term implications and positioning]

## üîÆ Next Version Outlook
[Planned focus and transition strategy]

## üìã Version Statistics
[Quantified achievements and metrics]
```

#### **Project Management Integration**
- **GitHub Project Cleanup**: Projects should be archived/deleted after release to maintain focus
- **Issue Migration**: Implementation issues created during planning belong to next version
- **Milestone Closure**: All Phase milestones should be completed before version release
- **Historical Record**: Release notes serve as permanent record when projects are cleaned

### Artifact Strategy by Release Type

#### **Planning Releases**
- **Documentation Focus**: Comprehensive architecture and planning documentation
- **No Binary Artifacts**: Skip package creation and installation packages
- **Historical Preservation**: Emphasis on complete development history archiving
- **Strategic Record**: Detailed achievement summaries for lasting reference

#### **Implementation Releases**
- **Binary Artifacts**: Include tested application packages and distributions
- **Installation Documentation**: Updated installation guides and deployment documentation
- **Testing Validation**: Include release testing results and validation reports
- **User-Focused**: Emphasis on feature delivery and usability improvements

### Version Strategy Guidelines

#### **Version Numbering Strategy**
- **Major.Minor.Patch** format (e.g., X.Y.Z)
- **Planning Phases**: Increment minor version (X.Y.0 ‚Üí X.Y.1)
- **Implementation Phases**: Increment patch version (X.Y.1 ‚Üí X.Y.2)
- **Major Features**: Increment minor version (X.Y.x ‚Üí X.(Y+1).0)
- **Breaking Changes**: Increment major version (X.x.x ‚Üí (X+1).0.0)

#### **Release Criteria**
**Planning Release Criteria:**
- All Phase 1 planning issues completed across target epics
- Comprehensive architectural documentation created
- Implementation roadmap established with clear next steps
- Development infrastructure improvements documented

**Implementation Release Criteria:**
- Core functionality implemented and tested
- Binary artifacts validated through testing workflow
- Documentation updated to reflect implementation changes
- User-facing improvements ready for deployment

#### **Release Timing Strategy**
- **Natural Completion Points**: Release when meaningful work units are complete
- **Planning Completion**: When architectural foundations are established
- **Implementation Milestones**: When significant functionality is working and tested
- **Avoid Arbitrary Timing**: Release based on work completion, not calendar schedule

### Workflow Evolution Guidelines

#### **Process Improvements Framework**
1. **Release Notes Generation**: Template-based approach ensures comprehensive coverage
2. **Artifact Decision Point**: Early determination of artifact requirements per release type
3. **Project Cleanup Integration**: Systematic approach to project archival and cleanup
4. **Documentation Verification**: Checklist approach for ensuring complete documentation

#### **Future Workflow Enhancements**
- **Automated Testing Integration**: Include release testing validation in workflow
- **Documentation Cross-References**: Ensure all architecture docs are linked and complete
- **Release Type Detection**: Automatic identification of planning vs implementation releases
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Standardized release announcement and communication patterns

#### **Integration Points for Enhancement**
- **CI/CD Integration**: Future automation of release artifact creation and testing
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks for documentation completeness and link validation
- **Release Analytics**: Metrics collection on release frequency, size, and impact
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Systematic collection of release feedback for process improvement

### Release Process Evolution Strategy

#### **Continuous Improvement**
- **Post-Release Reviews**: Document lessons learned after each release
- **Process Refinement**: Update workflow based on actual execution experience
- **Tool Enhancement**: Improve automation and reduce manual effort over time
- **Documentation Maturation**: Evolve documentation standards based on user feedback

#### **Scalability Considerations**
- **Team Growth**: Process designed to support multiple contributors
- **Release Frequency**: Workflow optimized for regular, systematic releases
- **Complexity Management**: Clear separation of concerns and workflow responsibilities
- **Quality Maintenance**: Systematic approaches to maintaining high release quality

## Success Criteria

- All issues closed and current version work completed
- Git tag created and pushed for version release
- GitHub release created with comprehensive release notes
- Release artifacts generated according to project configuration
- Repository state validated as clean before release
- Version transition prepared for next development cycle
- Complete audit trail maintained throughout release process
