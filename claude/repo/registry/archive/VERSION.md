# VERSION Workflow

## Purpose
Main version management workflow that consolidates all version-related operations with intelligent state detection and user-guided routing.

## Trigger
**User-Friendly**: `version sesame`
**Technical**: `VERSION`

## Overview
This workflow provides version management coordination:
1. Analyzes current version state and project configuration
2. Detects version management context and readiness
3. Presents appropriate version management options to the user
4. Coordinates with specialized version workflows based on user choice
5. Enforces version management rules and best practices

## Critical Version Management Rules

### 1. Version Scope Control (MANDATORY)
**Issue List = Backlog + Completed Work:**
- ALL issues (open + closed) represent complete project history
- Issues and milestones are NEVER removed - only closed when completed
- Provides permanent historical tracking across all versions

**Milestones = Version Phases:**
- Milestones define phases within specific versions
- **Pattern**: `[EPIC]-[VERSION]: [EPIC_NAME] - Phase [N]`
- **Examples**: `SE-1: External Install - Phase 1`, `CAE-1: Core API - Phase 1`
- Milestones contain only work planned for that specific version

**Project = Current Version Only:**
- GitHub Project contains ONLY current version work
- Issues without milestones = future version candidates
- Clean project scope enables accurate progress tracking

### 2. Version Transition Protocol (MANDATORY)
**Before starting new version:**
- Close current project
- Create new project for next version
- Assign appropriate milestones to next-version issues
- Maintain clean separation between version scopes

**Version completion triggers:**
- Comprehensive release report
- Report includes: completed issues, milestone phases, epic progress
- Provides full accountability for version deliverables

### 3. Task Creation Process (MANDATORY)
**Backlog to Completion Workflow:**
- **Backlog (Unplanned)**: High-level issues without milestones
- **Planned Work - Task Creation**: Parent issues assigned milestones, decomposed into child issues
- **Planned Work - Implementation**: Child issues executed following single-step rule
- **Completion**: Parent closed when all children complete

**Task Creation Rules:**
- **Mandatory Decomposition**: Parent issues MUST be broken into child issues before implementation
- **Parent-Child Linking**: Child issues MUST reference parent for traceability
- **Issue Count Increase Expected**: Task creation increases issue count - this is healthy decomposition
- **Milestone Inheritance**: Child issues inherit milestone from parent

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Project Configuration Detection
**Read Project Configuration:**
- Load `claude/project/version-config.md` for project-specific version settings
- Load `claude/project/project-info.md` for general project information
- Extract version strategy, current version, and project identity

**Validate Configuration:**
- Verify project hooks exist and are properly formatted
- Check current version state and numbering consistency
- Validate milestone and project alignment

### 2. Version State Analysis
**Current Version Assessment:**
- Analyze open/closed issues in current milestones
- Check GitHub project status and completion
- Evaluate release readiness based on milestone completion
- Assess planning vs implementation state

**Classification Logic:**
```
No current version setup → NEW_VERSION_PLANNING candidate
Active milestones with open issues → Development in progress
All milestones complete, no release → RELEASE_PROCESS candidate
Recent release, planning needed → NEW_VERSION_PLANNING candidate
Mid-transition state → VERSION_TRANSITION candidate
```

### 3. User Option Presentation
Based on version state detection, present relevant options:

**For New Project (no version setup):**
```
Detected: Project with no version management structure

Version Management Options:
1. Initialize Version Management - Set up version structure and planning
2. Skip Version Management - Continue with ad-hoc development
3. Cancel - Exit without changes

Choose option [1-3]:
```

**For Active Development:**
```
Detected: Active development in progress (Version X.Y.Z)
- Open Issues: N across M milestones
- Completion: X% of current version milestones

Version Management Options:
1. Plan Next Version - Create planning for upcoming version
2. Execute Version Transition - Move to next development phase
3. Create Release - Complete current version (if ready)
4. Review Version Status - Show detailed version progress
5. Cancel - Exit without changes

Choose option [1-5]:
```

**For Release-Ready State:**
```
Detected: Version ready for release (All milestones complete)
- Current Version: X.Y.Z
- Completed Issues: N
- Release Artifacts: [Status]

Version Management Options:
1. Create Release - Execute full release process
2. Review Release Readiness - Validate release criteria
3. Plan Next Version - Begin next version planning
4. Cancel - Exit without changes

Choose option [1-4]:
```

### 4. Version Workflow Coordination
Coordinate with appropriate specialized workflow based on user selection:

**Initialize/Plan Version:** → `NEW_VERSION_PLANNING` workflow
**Execute Transition:** → `VERSION_TRANSITION` workflow
**Create Release:** → `RELEASE_PROCESS` workflow
**Review Status:** → Generate comprehensive version status report

### 5. Post-Workflow Integration
After workflow completion:
- Update project configuration with new version state
- Verify version management rules compliance
- Generate summary of changes made
- Provide guidance for next steps

## Project Configuration Integration

### Required Project Configuration
**claude/project/version-config.md:**
- PROJECT_NAME, CURRENT_VERSION, VERSION_PATTERN
- RELEASE_TYPE, ARTIFACT_CONFIGURATION
- BUILD_COMMANDS, TEST_COMMANDS

**claude/project/project-info.md:**
- Project identity and description
- Repository configuration
- Development team information

### Configuration Validation
- Verify all required configuration files exist before workflow execution
- Validate configuration format and required fields
- Provide clear error messages for missing or invalid configuration
- Guide user to create missing configuration when needed

## Error Handling

### Missing Project Configuration
- Detect missing or invalid project configuration files
- Guide user through configuration creation process
- Provide templates for required configuration files
- Validate configuration before proceeding

### Version State Conflicts
- Detect conflicting version states (e.g., multiple active versions)
- Present resolution options to user
- Guide through cleanup processes
- Ensure version management rule compliance

### Workflow Failures
- Monitor workflow execution status
- Capture and report error conditions
- Provide rollback guidance where applicable
- Log failures for troubleshooting

## Integration Points

### With Version Workflows
- **NEW_VERSION_PLANNING** - Version and milestone planning
- **VERSION_TRANSITION** - Phase transitions and project updates
- **RELEASE_PROCESS** - Complete release execution

### With Project Management
- **GitHub Projects** - Current version work tracking
- **Issues and Milestones** - Work organization and completion
- **Release Management** - Artifact creation and distribution

### With Development Workflows
- **PLANNED_VS_UNPLANNED** - Work classification and routing
- **NEXT_ISSUE** - Issue selection within version context
- **GITHUB_WORKFLOW** - Project and milestone management

## Success Criteria
- Accurate version state detection and analysis
- Appropriate option presentation based on current state
- Successful workflow coordination and execution
- Version management rules compliance maintained
- Project hooks properly updated and maintained
- Clear user guidance for next steps

## Expected Outputs
- Comprehensive version state analysis
- User-selected version management path
- Successful workflow execution
- Updated project configuration hooks
- Version management compliance validation
- Strategic guidance for continued development
