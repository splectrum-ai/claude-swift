# Create in-repo cache for issue information management

## Description
Create a local cache for issue information to improve issue management efficiency. Once issues are created their information remains the same except for metadata. By creating a local cache it is a lot easier to manage the issue. Cache entry starts at issue creation, updates are made to cache first and then applied to GitHub, issues are removed from cache once they are closed.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Significant performance improvement for issue management workflows and reduces GitHub API calls

## Dependencies

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Medium complexity requiring cache design, file management, and GitHub API integration

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Cache system creates entries when issues are created
- [ ] Cache stores complete issue information (title, description, labels, etc.)
- [ ] Updates are applied to cache first, then synchronized to GitHub
- [ ] Cache entries are removed when issues are closed
- [ ] Cache survives session boundaries and provides persistence
- [ ] Cache integrates with existing issue workflows (NEXT_ISSUE, CREATE_ISSUE, etc.)
- [ ] Performance improvement measurable in reduced GitHub API calls
- [ ] Cache consistency maintained between local state and GitHub state

## Work Area: v1.1.0
**Context:** Performance optimization and local state management for improved issue workflow efficiency
