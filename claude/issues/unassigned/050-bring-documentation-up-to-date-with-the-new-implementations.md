**Source**: sesameh/claude-swift  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Type**: documentation  
**Created**: 2025-07-14T14:51:14.617Z

## Description
Final documentation update before v1.1.0 release. Update all documentation to reflect the recent changes including the migration of orchestrator-specific workflows to the project area.

## Context
This is the last issue before the version will be closed and released. Critical for ensuring users have accurate documentation for v1.1.0.

## Requirements
- [ ] Update main README.md to reflect current project structure
- [ ] Update workflow documentation to reference new locations for INITIALISE, PROJECT_REGISTER, and OUTBOX
- [ ] Verify all workflow cross-references point to correct locations
- [ ] Update any setup or getting started guides to reflect orchestrator-specific workflows
- [ ] Review and update API documentation if affected
- [ ] Ensure CLAUDE.md mandatory rule is clear about checking project registry

## Test Criteria
- [ ] All documentation files have correct paths and references
- [ ] No broken links between workflow documents
- [ ] Setup instructions work for new users
- [ ] Orchestrator-specific features are clearly marked

## Priority Justification
Critical for v1.1.0 release - users need accurate documentation to use the new workflow structure

## Effort Estimate
Effort: M (Multiple documentation files need review and updates)

## Dependencies
Blocks: Version 1.1.0 release
Blocked by: None (all implementation work complete)
Related: Issue #49 (workflow migration)
