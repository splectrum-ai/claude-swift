Remove the repo todo, the workflow associated with it and all references from the operational information. This is superseded by the task, inbox and outbox patterns.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Justification:** Cleanup task to remove obsolete functionality, moderate importance for codebase clarity

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Multiple files need updates but patterns are well-defined

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Repo todo workflow file removed
- [ ] All references removed from operational documentation
- [ ] Keywords/triggers updated appropriately
- [ ] No broken references remain

## Work Area: operational-cleanup
**Context:** Cross-repository task created via TASK_CREATE workflow
