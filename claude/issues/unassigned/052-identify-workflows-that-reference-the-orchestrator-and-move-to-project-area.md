# Identify workflows that reference the orchestrator and move to project area

## Description
Identify workflows that reference the orchestrator (claude-swift, the repo with the projects folder) and move the workflows into the project area. This needs analysis first before implementation.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical architectural cleanup to properly separate orchestrator-specific workflows from generic WoW framework

## Dependencies

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Analysis-focused task with well-defined scope and clear migration patterns

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] All workflows analyzed for orchestrator references
- [ ] Orchestrator-specific workflows identified and categorized
- [ ] Migration plan designed for moving workflows to project area
- [ ] Implementation approach validated before execution
- [ ] Clear separation between generic WoW and orchestrator-specific functionality

## Work Area: v1.1.0
**Context:** Architectural improvement to properly organize workflows by scope - generic framework vs orchestrator-specific functionality
