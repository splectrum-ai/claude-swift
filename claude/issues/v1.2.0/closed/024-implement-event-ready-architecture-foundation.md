# Implement Event-Ready Architecture Foundation

Problem Statement
## Overview
Transform workflows into event-emitting tools ready for choreography while maintaining backward compatibility. This lays the foundation for the future event-driven architecture where workflows become decomposed tools that emit events for orchestration.

## Current State
- Workflows are monolithic bash functions
- No event emission or choreography capability
- Difficult to compose or automate workflows
- Limited observability into workflow execution

## Target State
- Workflows decomposed into discrete event-emitting tools
- Standardized event format for choreography
- Dual-mode execution (interactive + automated)
- Ready for distributed execution

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Event Instrumentation
- [ ] Create standardized `emit_event()` function
- [ ] Add event logging infrastructure at `claude/project/events/event.log`
- [ ] Instrument existing workflows with event emission
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with current workflows

### Phase 2: Tool Decomposition
- [ ] Extract discrete operations from COMMIT workflow
- [ ] Create tool registry for decomposed operations
- [ ] Standardize input/output contracts for tools
- [ ] Implement tool-level event emission

### Phase 3: Choreography Foundation
- [ ] Design event bus architecture
- [ ] Create choreography engine for event-driven flows
- [ ] Define flow definitions (YAML-based)
- [ ] Implement event subscription/routing

## Technical Specification

### Event Format
```bash
emit_event() {
    local event_type=Problem Statement
    local operation=$2
    local context=$3
    local payload=$4
    local timestamp=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%3NZ)
    
    echo "${timestamp} < /dev/null | EVENT|${event_type}|${operation}|${context}|${payload}" >> claude/project/events/event.log
}
```

### Tool Structure
```bash
# Example: stage_files_tool with event emission
stage_files_tool() {
    local mode=${MODE:-interactive}
    local files=("$@")
    
    # Pre-conditions
    validate_git_state || emit_event "error" "git_state_invalid"
    
    # Operation
    if [ "$mode" = "interactive" ]; then
        echo "Staging ${#files[@]} files..."
    fi
    
    git add "${files[@]}"
    
    # Post-conditions & Events
    emit_event "files_staged" "stage_files" "" "${#files[@]} files"
    
    # Return state for choreography
    echo "{"
    echo "  \"status\": \"success\","
    echo "  \"files_count\": ${#files[@]},"
    echo "  \"next_events\": [\"commit_requested\"]"
    echo "}"
}
```

### Choreography Example
```yaml
choreography:
  name: commit_flow
  triggers:
    - event: changes_detected
  
  flow:
    - on: changes_detected
      emit: validation_requested
    - on: changes_validated
      emit: staging_requested
    - on: files_staged
      emit: commit_requested
    - on: commit_created
      parallel:
        - emit: issue_detection_requested
        - emit: audit_log_requested
```

## Test Plan
- [ ] Create event logging test suite
- [ ] Test tool decomposition with COMMIT workflow
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility with existing workflows
- [ ] Test dual-mode execution (interactive + automated)
- [ ] Validate event emission and choreography readiness

## Success Criteria
- All workflows emit standardized events
- Tools can be executed independently
- Events are properly logged and accessible
- Choreography foundation is ready for future automation
- No breaking changes to existing workflow usage

## Dependencies
- JavaScript audit logging system (already implemented)
- Existing workflow infrastructure
- Event logging directory structure

## Reference Documentation
- `claude/wow/optimizations/EVENT_READY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
