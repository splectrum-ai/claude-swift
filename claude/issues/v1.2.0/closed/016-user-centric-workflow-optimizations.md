# User-Centric Workflow Optimizations

## Description
Implement user experience improvements for workflow automation and selection to reduce cognitive load and improve workflow efficiency.

Priority optimizations:
1. **Smart Workflow Detection with Approval**: Auto-detect appropriate workflows based on context (changes detected → suggest commit sesame, post-commit → suggest next sesame) but always prompt for user approval/continuation
2. **Enhanced Workflow Chains**: Automated workflow sequencing (finish sesame → auto-suggest start sesame in next session, release sesame → auto-suggest version sesame for next version)
3. **Context-Aware Workflow Memory**: Remember last workflow patterns and suggest logical next steps based on session history
4. **Intelligent Batching Enhancement**: Expand existing batch operations (commit+push+issue-close already implemented) to include more workflow combinations

Implementation approach:
- Build on existing automation infrastructure
- Maintain user control with approval prompts
- Focus on reducing cognitive load while preserving user agency
- Leverage current audit logging for workflow pattern detection

Expected impact: 40% reduction in manual workflow selection, 60% faster session transitions
