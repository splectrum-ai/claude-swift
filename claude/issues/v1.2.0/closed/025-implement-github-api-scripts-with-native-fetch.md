# Implement GitHub API Scripts with Native Fetch

## Description
Create bare-conversion friendly GitHub API scripts using native fetch() instead of @octokit/rest. Replace all 23 GitHub CLI commands across 8 workflows with lightweight JavaScript implementations. Focus on issue management, release automation, and cache synchronization with zero dependencies.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Core infrastructure improvement that enables cross-repository workflow automation and reduces external dependencies

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** #52, #54, #55, #60
**Blocked by:** 
**Related:** #52, #54, #55, #60

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Multiple API endpoints to implement, comprehensive testing required, integration with existing workflows

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Native fetch() GitHub API client implemented
- [ ] All 23 GitHub CLI commands replaceable with JS scripts
- [ ] Issue management operations (create, edit, list, close)
- [ ] Release automation (create releases with artifacts)
- [ ] Cache synchronization with delta sync
- [ ] Zero external dependencies (bare-conversion friendly)
- [ ] Error handling and rate limiting
- [ ] JSON output compatibility with existing workflows

## Work Area: v1.2.0
**Context:** Learning opportunity for bare-conversion friendly JavaScript. Replaces @octokit/rest heavyweight dependency with lightweight native fetch implementation.
