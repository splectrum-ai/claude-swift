# Implement Happy Path + Deferred Exception Prototype

## Description
Implement a comprehensive prototype of the Happy Path + Deferred Exception operational pattern within claude-swift workflows. This serves as the practical validation of the operational philosophy being documented in SPlectrum, creating a concrete implementation that other systems can reference.

The prototype transforms workflows from "fail fast" to "succeed fast, fix later" through intelligent exception handling that creates actionable work items for infrastructure problems while ensuring primary functions always complete.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** This prototype validates the operational pattern theory with practical implementation, providing concrete examples for SPlectrum documentation and establishing claude-swift as reference implementation for resilient operational patterns.

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** Operational pattern validation, reference implementation for other SPlectrum systems
**Blocked by:** None (builds on existing workflow infrastructure and Node.js audit logging)
**Related:** SPlectrum operational philosophy documentation task, INBOX milestone handling improvements

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Large effort due to comprehensive implementation across multiple workflows, creation of deferred exception infrastructure, and validation of pattern effectiveness.

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Created deferred exception infrastructure in `claude/wow/scripts/lib/exceptions.js`
- [ ] Implemented automatic bug task creation for infrastructure problems
- [ ] Enhanced INBOX workflow with full deferred exception handling
- [ ] Created audit logging enhancements for warning classification
- [ ] Updated SESSION_START workflow with deferred exception patterns
- [ ] Updated ISSUE_CACHE workflow with resilient error handling
- [ ] Created decision framework implementation for exception classification
- [ ] Implemented orphaned issue tracking and retroactive assignment
- [ ] Added comprehensive testing for deferred exception scenarios
- [ ] Documented prototype implementation patterns for reference

## Work Area: operational-patterns
**Context:** Practical implementation of the operational philosophy pattern discovered during INBOX milestone handling development. This prototype serves as validation and reference for SPlectrum systems.

### Implementation Components:

**1. Deferred Exception Infrastructure**
```javascript
// claude/wow/scripts/lib/exceptions.js
class DeferredException {
  constructor(type, description, affectedItems, remediation) {
    this.type = type;
    this.description = description;
    this.affectedItems = affectedItems;
    this.remediation = remediation;
    this.timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  }
  
  createTask() {
    // Generate self-targeted bug task
  }
}
```

**2. Enhanced INBOX Implementation**
- Missing milestone detection â†’ Bug task creation
- Orphaned issue tracking â†’ Retroactive assignment task
- Cache inconsistency â†’ Maintenance task generation
- Primary function (issue creation) always succeeds

**3. Audit Log Warning Classification**
- Environmental issues â†’ Audit warnings only
- Performance degradation â†’ Monitoring data
- Transient failures â†’ Warning logs
- Infrastructure gaps â†’ Deferred exception tasks

**4. Decision Framework Implementation**
```bash
handle_exception() {
  local problem="Problem Statement"
  local context="$2"
  
  if can_create_task_to_fix "$problem"; then
    create_deferred_exception_task "$problem" "$context"
  elif is_immediate_failure "$problem"; then
    exit 1  # Fail fast for critical issues
  else
    audit_log "WARNING" "environmental" "$problem" "" "$context"
  fi
}
```

**5. Self-Repair Mechanics**
- Automatic bug task generation
- Affected item tracking (issue numbers, file paths)
- Clear remediation steps in generated tasks
- Integration with existing workflow infrastructure

**6. Prototype Validation**
- Test scenarios for each exception type
- Validation of primary function preservation
- Measurement of operational debt visibility
- Comparison with traditional fail-fast approaches

### Integration Points:
- **INBOX**: Missing milestone â†’ Bug task + continue processing
- **SESSION_START**: Missing cache â†’ Rebuild task + continue session
- **ISSUE_CACHE**: Sync failures â†’ Retry task + use stale cache
- **CREATE_ISSUE**: API failures â†’ Manual creation task + continue

### Success Metrics:
- **Resilience**: Primary functions complete despite infrastructure problems
- **Visibility**: Infrastructure debt becomes tracked work items
- **Automation**: Self-repair tasks provide clear remediation paths
- **Reference**: Other systems can adopt proven patterns

This prototype establishes claude-swift as the reference implementation for resilient operational patterns while providing practical validation of the theoretical framework being developed in SPlectrum.
