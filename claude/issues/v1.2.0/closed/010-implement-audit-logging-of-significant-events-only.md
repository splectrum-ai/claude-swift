# Implement audit logging of significant events only

Problem Statement
## Cross-Repository Task

**Source**: claude-swift  
**Type**: workflow-update  
**Created**: 2025-07-17T05:48:14.805Z  
**Priority**: HIGH

---

## Description
Optimize audit logging across all workflows to log only significant events instead of granular step-by-step operations. Current logging includes too many minor steps (config_verified, inbox_check, mandatory_scan) which creates noise. Focus on major milestones and state changes only.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical for improving workflow maintainability and audit log readability - affects all development workflows

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** 
**Blocked by:** 
**Related:** 

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Medium complexity - requires reviewing all workflow files and updating audit_log calls systematically

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] SESSION_START workflow logs only: workflow_start, session_recovery (if needed), cache_sync_complete, task_processing_complete (if applicable), workflow_complete
- [ ] All other workflows follow pattern: workflow_start, major milestones only, workflow_complete
- [ ] AUDIT_REFERENCE.md updated with "significant events only" guidelines
- [ ] Sample audit log demonstrates reduced noise while preserving important events
- [ ] All workflow files updated consistently

## Work Area: v1.2.0
**Context:** Perform this task in collaboration to discuss significant steps for each workflow before implementation
