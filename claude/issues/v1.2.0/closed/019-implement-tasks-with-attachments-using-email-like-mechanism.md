# Implement tasks with attachments using email-like mechanism

Problem Statement
## Cross-Repository Task

**Source**: claude-swift  
**Type**: enhancement  
**Created**: 2025-07-17T06:15:11.057Z  
**Priority**: HIGH

---

## Description
Enhance the TASK_CREATE and INBOX workflows to support file attachments in cross-repository tasks. Use email MIME-like approach with base64 encoding for file transport. INBOX workflow should decode attachments and place them in a standardized git-managed directory structure.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Enables file sharing through task mechanism, critical for cross-repository coordination and workflow automation

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** 
**Blocked by:** 
**Related:** Audit logging optimization task

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Well-defined requirements from discussion, clear implementation pattern following email mechanisms

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] TASK_CREATE workflow prompts for file attachments during task creation
- [ ] Task files support YAML metadata with attachment specifications (filename, content-type, encoding)
- [ ] Files encoded as base64 in task file body with clear section markers
- [ ] INBOX workflow automatically decodes attachments
- [ ] Attachments placed in `claude/cache_attachments/issue-{number}/` directory structure
- [ ] GitHub issues reference attachment location in standardized format
- [ ] Attachment directory is git-managed (not gitignored) for full history tracking
- [ ] End-to-end test: create task with attachments, process through INBOX, verify files created correctly

## Work Area: v1.2.0
**Context:** Implementation details from collaborative discussion on email MIME approach

## Technical Requirements

### Task File Format Enhancement
- **YAML metadata** includes attachments array with filename, content-type, encoding
- **Base64 encoding** for all file content (text and binary)
- **Section markers** clearly separate file content in task body
- **Original filenames** preserved for reconstruction

### INBOX Workflow Enhancement  
- **Automatic detection** of tasks with attachments
- **Directory creation**: `claude/cache_attachments/issue-{number}/`
- **Base64 decoding** and file reconstruction
- **Git commit** of attachment files alongside issue creation
- **Issue reference** includes standardized attachment location format

### Directory Structure
```
claude/
├── project/
├── cache_attachments/          # New directory
│   ├── issue-123/
│   │   ├── config.json
│   │   ├── script.sh
│   │   └── workflow.md
│   └── README.md
└── wow/
```

### File Size Considerations
- **Reasonable limits** to prevent repository bloat
- **Error handling** for oversized attachments
- **Compression** consideration for large text files

## Example Enhanced Task Format
```markdown
---
source: repo-a
target: repo-b
attachments:
  - filename: config.json
    content-type: application/json
    encoding: base64
  - filename: script.sh
    content-type: text/x-shellscript
    encoding: base64
