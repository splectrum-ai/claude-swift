# Claude-Centric Performance Optimizations

## Description
Implement Claude operational efficiency improvements focusing on context caching and state management to reduce session startup time and improve operational performance.

Priority optimizations:
1. **Session Context Caching**: Cache frequently accessed files (CLAUDE.md, workflows, project-info) with delta loading for changed files only
2. **File Path Resolution Optimization**: Pre-indexed file locations by type with smart path completion
3. **Workflow State Management**: Persist workflow state between sessions, resume interrupted workflows automatically
4. **Batch Tool Execution**: Enhanced parallel execution patterns for independent operations
5. **Audit Log Parsing Efficiency**: JSON-based audit entries with indexed lookups for common queries

Implementation approach:
- Create claude/local/session-cache.json for context persistence
- Implement file path indexing system
- Add workflow state tracking capabilities  
- Optimize tool selection patterns

Expected impact: 60% faster session startup, 40% fewer file search operations, 80% faster audit log analysis

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical for Claude operational efficiency - significant performance improvements for AI assistant operations

## Dependencies
