# OPERATIONAL_RULES

## Critical Collaboration Rules (Foundational Governance)

**MANDATORY OPERATIONAL OPTIMIZATION**: Claude MUST optimize operational documentation for collaborative execution patterns where users provide strategic direction and Claude executes tactical implementation.

**MANDATORY COLLABORATIVE DECISION-MAKING**: All significant decisions and actions MUST be discussed through dialogue - asking questions, providing options, and confirming direction before execution.

**Purpose**: These foundational rules govern how human-AI collaboration operates across all workflows and ensure strategic control remains with the user while optimizing execution for AI capabilities.

## MUST Rules (Non-Negotiable Requirements)

### Critical Step-by-Step Execution Pattern
**MANDATORY WORKFLOW PATTERN**: All work MUST follow single-step completion with choice points.

#### 1. Single-Step Completion
- Each step is a complete, meaningful achievement
- Mark step as DONE immediately upon completion
- NO automatic progression to "next step" of same task

#### 2. Choice Point After Every Step
- After completing ANY step, PAUSE and present options:
  - Continue with related next step
  - Switch to different priority item
  - Address urgent issues
  - End session

#### 3. Item Granularity
- ALL work items MUST be single completable steps
- ❌ "Implement user authentication" 
- ✅ "Create GitHub issue for auth prototype"
- ✅ "Research authentication library options"
- ✅ "Write login flow example"

#### 4. Progress Recognition
- Celebrate each completed step as meaningful progress
- **AUTOMATIC**: Audit logging triggered when repository todo items are completed - all required fields naturally available at completion point
- **SINGLE SYSTEM**: Use repository todo list only for all work tracking

**Purpose**: Prevents tunnel vision, enables dynamic re-prioritization, provides clear progress tracking, and ensures collaborative decision-making at every step.

### Propose Before Execute Pattern

**MANDATORY EXECUTION PATTERN**: All significant changes MUST follow the Propose → Review/Gate → Execute pattern.

#### 1. Proposal Requirements
- Present complete action plan before any execution
- Include rationale for proposed changes
- List specific steps to be taken
- Identify potential impacts or risks
- Enable quality gating for automation readiness

#### 2. Execution Gates
- **Structural Changes**: File/folder operations, workflow modifications
- **Multi-Step Operations**: Any operation involving 3+ steps
- **Irreversible Actions**: Deletions, major refactoring, API changes
- **Cross-System Impact**: Changes affecting multiple workflows or projects

#### 3. Pattern Examples
```
❌ BAD: Directly execute `rm -rf docs/old-folder/`
✅ GOOD: "I propose to remove docs/old-folder/ because it contains outdated deployment documentation. This involves: 1) Verifying no active references, 2) Creating archive if needed, 3) Removing folder. May I proceed?"

❌ BAD: Start refactoring without discussion
✅ GOOD: "I propose to refactor the NEXT_ISSUE workflow to support multiple recommendations. This will involve updating 3 sections and modifying the output format. Here's my plan: [details]. Does this align with your vision?"
```

#### 4. Automation Readiness
- Creates natural quality gates for future automation
- Enables approve/reject decision points
- Provides audit trail of proposed vs executed actions
- Supports risk assessment before execution

**Purpose**: Ensures collaborative control, prevents unintended changes, enables automation quality gates, and maintains clear decision audit trails.

### Universal Methodology
- **Discuss, Think, Plan, Start**: For all significant work, follow this methodology - initiate discussions, request planning time, create planning documents, then implement
- **Ask, Don't Assume**: Always confirm understanding before taking action - collaboration requires confirmation, not assumption

### File and Path Management  
- **File Path Specification**: All file references MUST specify exact file paths (e.g., `claude/project/audit/current/current.log` NOT "log in timelog")
- **Always return to repo root** after any subdirectory operations

### Audit and Documentation
- **Audit Format Enforcement**: Before ANY audit logging, verify correct format: `TIMESTAMP|WORKFLOW|STEP_TYPE|CONTEXT|FILE_PATH|DESCRIPTION`
- **Audit tracking REQUIRED** - Update current audit log at every activity transition, issue switch, and session boundary
- **Document learnings REQUIRED** - At session end, capture "What have I learned?" in appropriate docs/ files

### Version Control and Project Management
- **Main Branch Only**: All work committed directly to main branch
- **Commit Protocol**: Complete work with clear commits (stage → commit → push)
- **Stage all files before commit** - Work packages are atomic, use `git add .`
- **Assign issues to milestones** - All issues must be assigned to appropriate epic phase milestone

### Documentation Standards
**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION RULES**:
1. **File Location**: All documentation MUST be created in `docs/` directory or appropriate subdirectory
2. **Homepage Back Links**: All documentation files MUST include back link to README.md at TOP of file
3. **Back Link Format**: `[← Back Home](../README.md)` (adjust path as needed)
4. **No External Documentation**: NEVER create documentation files outside `docs/` hierarchy
5. **README.md Content Organization**: README.md contents MUST reflect docs/ folder contents FIRST, followed by claude/ folder contents of interest to users

**AUTOMATIC CORRECTION**: When documentation files are found outside `docs/`, Claude MUST:
1. Move files to appropriate `docs/` subdirectory
2. Update all references to new locations
3. Fix homepage back links to be at top of files

## SHOULD Rules (Strong Recommendations)
- **Create issues for significant work** - When discussion leads to implementation decisions, create GitHub issue before starting work to enable proper tracking and documentation
- **Close issues on completion** - Mark issues complete when work is finished, with judgment required on completion criteria
- **Use named arguments** - `spl/app/run -f script.js -a args` NOT `spl/app/run script.js args`
- **Correct command syntax** - `./spl_execute <install-folder> <app-name> <command>` (e.g., `./spl_execute spl boot usr/apps_to_release`)
- **Test batch files first** with `spl/app/exec -f` before generating usr/ commands
- **Follow existing code patterns** - Mimic style, libraries, and conventions in codebase
- **Documentation housekeeping** - When features completed, REMOVE planning/scaffolding docs entirely
- **Decision logging** - Log strategic/architectural decisions in `docs/decision-log.md` when they meet decision criteria (strategic changes, technical architecture, workflow changes, technology adoption, epic modifications)

## PREFER Rules (Better Choices When Options Exist)
- **PREFER editing existing files** over creating new ones
- **PREFER rg (ripgrep)** over grep for searching
- **PREFER Task tool** for unknown codebase exploration
- **PREFER direct tools** (Read, Glob) for specific known files

## AVOID Rules (Generally Don't Do)
- **AVOID in-code defaults** (`|| "value"`) - causes hidden bugs
- **AVOID creating unnecessary documentation** - only create when explicitly requested
- **AVOID mixing concerns** - Script vs Batch: `scripts/` for multi-language, `batches/` for SPL

## CONTEXTUAL Rules (Situation-Dependent Guidelines)
- **Module locations**: Check app's `spl.js` - Global (`/modules/`) vs install (`/spl/modules/`)
- **Debug mode**: Use `./spl_execute spl app-name -d command` when troubleshooting
- **Path issues**: Use `spl.context(input, "cwd")` for install root resolution
- **Test help**: All commands support `-h` or `--help` for guidance
