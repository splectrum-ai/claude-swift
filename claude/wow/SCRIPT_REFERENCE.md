# Script Reference - Claude Workflow Scripts

Comprehensive reference for all executable scripts in the Claude workflow system.

## Overview

All scripts use Node.js with shebang execution (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) and can be called directly:
```bash
claude/wow/scripts/script-name [options]
```

**Only the main script files in `claude/wow/scripts/` directory can be executed directly. Subdirectory scripts are internal/support files.**

## SPL Integration (Development Use)

**IMPORTANT**: The repository has a new `spl_execute` command router at `/home/herma/splectrum/spl1/spl_execute` that is actively being used for development work with the spl-dev install. While not yet ready for general production use, it provides a unified execution point with app/module command overlay capabilities.

**Current Status**: 
- ‚úÖ In active use for development work (spl-dev)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet ready for general/production use
- üîÑ Features are being migrated from scripts to SPL commands

During the transition phase, both script patterns and SPL commands are available. This reference will be updated as more features are migrated to the SPL system.

**Available Commands**: 
- `start-initialize` - Check session state and handle recovery
- `start-complete` - Complete session initialization workflow
- `end-session --message="<commit message>"` - Handle session termination and archiving with meaningful commit message

session-manage end-session --message="Complete feature implementation and testing"
```

#### `project-manage`
**Purpose**: Project-level management operations  
**Available Commands**: 
- `init-issues` - Initialize local issues structure
- `sync-templates` - Sync templates from framework (preserves custom)

#### `transition-manage`
**Purpose**: Unified transition and version management operations  
**Available Commands**: 
- `version-transition` - Execute full version transition process
- `new-version-planning` - Plan next version development
- `patch-release [version]` - Execute patch release workflow
- `knowledge-sync [args]` - Synchronize knowledge base
- `knowledge-update [args]` - Update knowledge base documentation
- `maintenance-analysis [args]` - Analyze repository maintenance needs
- `strategic-analysis [args]` - Generate strategic insights
- `readiness-validation [args]` - Validate version readiness
- `get-started [args]` - Generate onboarding documentation

**Examples**:
```bash
transition-manage version-transition
transition-manage patch-release v1.2.1
transition-manage knowledge-sync --target docs
```

### Task and Workflow Scripts

#### `task-create`
**Purpose**: Task creation and management  
**Note**: Script has execution issues (shebang line ending problem)

#### `inbox-process`
**Purpose**: Process inbox tasks and convert to issues  
**Behavior**: Processes tasks from inbox directory, creates GitHub issues

#### `outbox-process`
**Purpose**: Collect and distribute cross-repository tasks  
**Behavior**: Routes tasks between repositories in orchestrator mode

## Integration Patterns

### Workflow Usage
```bash
# In workflow files
claude/wow/scripts/audit-manage log "WORKFLOW" "start" "init" "" "Starting workflow"
claude/wow/scripts/git-manage status
claude/wow/scripts/git-manage commit --message "Auto-generated commit"
claude/wow/scripts/issue-manage close 123
claude/wow/scripts/transition-manage version-transition
```

### Error Handling
All scripts follow consistent error handling:
- Exit code 0 for success
- Exit code 1 for user errors
- Exit code 2 for system errors
- Structured error messages to stderr

### Getting Help
Execute any script without arguments to see available commands:
```bash
claude/wow/scripts/audit-manage     # Shows all audit-manage commands
claude/wow/scripts/git-manage       # Shows all git-manage commands
claude/wow/scripts/issue-manage     # Shows all issue-manage commands
```

## Support Files and Libraries

### Internal Support Directories
- `audit/` - Audit-specific libraries and analyzers
- `git/` - Git operation implementations
- `github/` - GitHub API implementations
- `transition/` - Version transition engines
- `lib/` - Shared library modules
- `_old/` - Deprecated/legacy scripts (archived)

**Note**: Files in subdirectories are not directly executable and are used internally by the main scripts.

## Best Practices

### Script Execution
1. Always use full paths in workflows: `claude/wow/scripts/script-name`
2. Check exit codes for error handling
3. Use help (no arguments) to discover available commands
4. Include audit logging for workflow steps

### Error Recovery
1. Scripts provide meaningful error messages
2. Use `--dry-run` flags when available for testing
3. Check logs in `claude/project/audit/current/current.log`
4. Scripts are designed to be idempotent when possible
