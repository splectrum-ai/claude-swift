# PROJECT KEYWORD_REGISTRY

This file maintains project-specific workflow trigger keywords that extend the base WoW KEYWORD_REGISTRY.

## Project-Specific Keywords

Add project-specific workflow keywords here:

| Keyword | File | Purpose | Status |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| [EXAMPLE_KEYWORD] | [workflow-file.md] | [workflow purpose] | [Not created] |

## Project-Specific Customizations

### Workflow Customizations
Add any customizations to inherited workflows here.

## Registry Inheritance

This project registry extends the base WoW registry located at `../wow/KEYWORD_REGISTRY.md`. All base workflow keywords are inherited and available in this project context.

## Usage Pattern

For project-specific workflows:
```markdown
**PROJECT_KEYWORD** → See [workflows/PROJECT_FILENAME.md](./workflows/PROJECT_FILENAME.md)
```

For inherited WoW workflows, refer to the base registry at `../wow/KEYWORD_REGISTRY.md`.
