# Claude Installable Component Requirement

## Executive Summary

The claude operational system must become an installable component that can be independently versioned, updated, and deployed across multiple repositories. This component will include an embedded SE (Smart Executable) for autonomous operation and efficiency improvements.

## Business Requirement

**Current State**: Single claude 'way of working' embedded in spl1 repository
**Target State**: Multiple claude 'ways of working' available as installable components
**Critical Success Factor**: Projects can choose and update their claude operational approach independently

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### 1. Component Independence
- **Standalone Repository**: Claude component exists in separate repository
- **Version Management**: Independent semantic versioning (e.g., claude-workflows-v1.2.3)
- **Dependency Isolation**: No dependencies on host repository structure
- **Update Mechanism**: Component can be updated without affecting host repository code

### 2. SE Integration Requirements
- **Embedded SE**: Claude component contains dedicated SE for autonomous operation
- **Deployment Integration**: SE deploys automatically with claude component installation
- **Efficiency Target**: SE handles routine operational tasks autonomously
- **Compatibility**: SE integrates with existing audit logging and workflow systems

### 3. Multi-Repository Support
- **Template System**: Claude component works across different project types
- **Configuration Adaptation**: Component adapts to host repository structure
- **Workflow Customization**: Core workflows remain consistent, project-specific customizations supported
- **Installation Simplicity**: Single command installation process

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Component Extraction (Immediate)
1. **Repository Creation**: Create dedicated claude-workflows repository
2. **Component Structure**: Design installable component architecture
3. **SE Placeholder**: Create SE integration points
4. **Migration Path**: Define extraction process from spl1

### Phase 2: SE Implementation (Priority)
1. **SE Development**: Build claude-specific SE for operational automation
2. **Workflow Integration**: Integrate SE with existing workflow triggers
3. **Efficiency Automation**: Automate routine operational tasks
4. **Testing Framework**: Validate SE operations across different scenarios

### Phase 3: Multi-Repository Deployment (Future)
1. **Installation System**: Create component installation mechanism
2. **Version Management**: Implement update and rollback capabilities
3. **Template Library**: Multiple claude 'ways of working' variants
4. **Documentation**: Complete installation and configuration guides

## Critical Decision Points

### SE Architecture Decisions
- **SE Scope**: Which operational tasks should be automated?
- **Integration Model**: How does SE interact with existing tools and workflows?
- **Safety Controls**: What manual overrides and kill switches are required?
- **Performance**: What efficiency gains are expected from SE automation?

### Component Distribution
- **Repository Strategy**: Standalone repo vs. federated monorepo approach?
- **Version Compatibility**: How to handle breaking changes across component versions?
- **Installation Method**: Git submodule, package manager, or custom installer?
- **Configuration Management**: How much customization vs. standardization?

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits
- **Project Flexibility**: Choose appropriate claude 'way of working' for project needs
- **Operational Efficiency**: SE automation reduces manual operational overhead
- **Consistency**: Standardized operational approaches across projects
- **Maintainability**: Centralized claude component updates benefit all projects

### Risks
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer increases system complexity
- **Migration Effort**: Extracting from spl1 requires careful planning and testing
- **SE Dependencies**: Embedded SE creates new dependency and failure points
- **Version Management**: Multiple component versions may create compatibility issues

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Installation Time**: Component installs in < 5 minutes
- **Update Reliability**: Zero-downtime component updates
- **SE Efficiency**: 50%+ reduction in manual operational tasks
- **Cross-Repository Compatibility**: Works across 3+ different project types

### Operational Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: 80%+ of new projects use claude component
- **Operational Overhead**: Measurable reduction in session management time
- **Error Reduction**: Fewer operational mistakes due to SE automation
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Improved development workflow experience

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Document current claude component boundaries and dependencies
2. **Week 1**: Design claude component architecture and SE integration points
3. **Week 2**: Create extraction plan from spl1 with minimal disruption
4. **Week 3**: Begin SE development for core operational automation
5. **Month 1**: Complete component extraction and basic SE integration
6. **Month 2**: Deploy first installable claude component version

## Implementation Priority

**CRITICAL**: This requirement determines next version planning priorities. All planned work must consider claude component extraction and SE integration requirements.

**DEPENDENCIES**: 
- SE development capabilities
- Component architecture design
- Repository migration strategy
- Installation system design
