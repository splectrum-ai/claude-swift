# spl/app/eval

Evaluates JavaScript content that was prepared by the `spl/app/prepare` processing stage.

## Purpose

Executes JavaScript code content that has been processed and prepared through the SPL app pipeline, enabling dynamic execution of batch command content.

## Dependencies

Requires prior execution of `spl/app/prepare` which sets the `batch` configuration containing the JavaScript content to be evaluated.

## Configuration Access

- Reads from: `spl/app/prepare.batch` - JavaScript content prepared for execution

## Usage

```bash
# Typically used as part of a pipeline after spl/app/prepare
spl_execute dev spl/app/prepare @@ spl/app/eval
```

## Security Note

This method uses JavaScript `eval()` to execute prepared content. Content is expected to be pre-validated through the SPL app pipeline process.
