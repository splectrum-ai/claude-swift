# spl/void

Void API module containing methods that perform operations without returning data to the SPL workspace.

## Purpose

The void API provides operations that:
- Execute side effects (console output, external operations)
- Do not modify or return workspace data
- Complete successfully without data output

## Methods

- `noop` - No operation method for testing and placeholder functionality

## Usage

```bash
spl_execute dev spl/void/noop
```

## Design Pattern

Void methods follow the pattern:
- Execute intended side effects
- Log progress with spl.history()
- Complete with spl.completed()
- Return no data to workspace
